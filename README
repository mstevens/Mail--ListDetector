Mail::ListDetector
------------------

This module can be installed as standard for a CPAN module:

  perl Makefile.PL
  make 
  make test
  make install

It provides the ability to examine Mail::Internet objects to determine
if they were posted to a mailing list, and if so, which mailing list. See
examples/sample.pl for how to use the module.

The documentation is as yet very poor, and this module should be
considered to still have alpha status - I may change functionality or
the API at any time, and it may not actually DO anything for you. Or it
might delete all your files.

This module is licensed under the same terms as perl itself.
